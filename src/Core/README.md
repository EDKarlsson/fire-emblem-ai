# Core Components

Since I have no experience in game development nor AI, I'm pretty clueless where to start.
I'm positive I need to create character class to store information for each character on the screen.
I'll need to make a combat / board module to handle the game play. Though, I'm not sure how that divide that out into separate modules.

#### Initial design brainstorm
Characters reside on the board

Their interactions can either be positive or negative
Positive interactions:
1. Healing a unit
2. Buff unit
3. Sing - Dance : allow unit to move again

Negative interaction:
1. Attack unit
